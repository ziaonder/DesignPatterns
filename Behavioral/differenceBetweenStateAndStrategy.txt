Their structure looks completely same where you part the mechanisms, select the intended mechanism, run it. The only difference is who handles the state transition. 
State Pattern -> Concrete states handle the state transition and have more control over them. Restriction is possible.
Strategy Pattern -> Context handles the state transition. "Player" in my case.
